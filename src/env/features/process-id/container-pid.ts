/**
 * @module nexid/env/features/process-id/container-pid
 *
 * Derives a process identifier specifically for containerized environments.
 *
 * ARCHITECTURE:
 * Standard OS process IDs (`process.pid` or `Deno.pid`) are unreliable for
 * distinguishing instances within containers. Multiple containers on the same host
 * might share PID namespaces or have overlapping PIDs, leading to potential
 * collisions if host PIDs were used directly.
 *
 * To provide a more stable and unique identifier *per container instance*, this
 * module attempts to extract an ID string inherent to the container itself.
 * We prioritize common, reliable sources:
 * 1.  `HOSTNAME` env var: Often set to the container ID by runtimes like Docker.
 * 2.  `/proc/self/cpuset` / `/proc/self/cgroup`: These procfs entries typically
 *     contain the container's unique cgroup path, which includes its ID.
 *
 * The extracted identifier (usually a long hex string) is too large for the
 * 2-byte process ID field in an XID, so we take the lower 16 bits (`& 0xffffn`)
 * as a compromise. This preserves a good portion of the container's unique identity
 * while fitting the required format. A fallback to 0 is used if no reliable
 * container ID can be determined.
 *
 * SECURITY:
 * The chosen methods (environment variables, procfs reads) are generally safe
 * within a container, as they access information scoped to the container itself
 * and avoid executing external commands, minimizing security risks.
